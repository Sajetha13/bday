        <h1>Soulmates</h1>
        <p>
            Do u believe in soulmates
            I do, but I don't know what they exactly mean?
            Are they someone who u meet through ur course of life
            And u feel connected to them inside out?
            Or is it someone who u didn't care all this time and suddenly they show some care towards u?
            And they say, maybe we're soulmates. 

            I don't know 
            But I say to you, we're like soulmates 
            We're same souls in different bodies,
            Ik its dramtic
            But isn't it cute that u get to say that to someone 
            Even though u won't be forever 
            Even though u know it's just a phase
            It might be forever
            It might not be just a phase
            But we don't know what the future beholds
            And we should be readyb to face whatever that is
            Taking in all the love we could get from eachother 
            To be strong whenÂ we'reÂ apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ahh now thats a trick to make u read my poem, u thought i wrote it for u?ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
